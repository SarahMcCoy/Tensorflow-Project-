# Deep learning Tensorflow-Project-

## Objective 
For this project you will build a model that will attempt to predict whether or not someone will pay back their loan based on historical information. We will be using Tensorflow to perform a classification task. This sort of task is perfectly suited for Neural Networks and Deep Learning!

### Project at a Glance:
- Objective: build a model that will attempt to predict whether or not someone will pay back their loan based on historical information. 
- Project Tools: Python(libraries: Pandas and Scikit-learn) Data Visualization Tools: Seaborn and Matplotlib) and Tensorflow machine learning platform 
- Data: [Bank Authentication Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication)
